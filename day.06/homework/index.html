<!-- • • Container tag - Container tags consist of a short JavaScript code that is integrated into the source code of the sub-pages of a website. This JavaScript code is then used to later control the required tag. Here, a variety of tags, which are used throughout the entire website, are defined in the tag management. The website operator then specifies the various tags that should be displayed through the container tag of a certain page for a specific case. Here, rules are set that for instance, check the visited URLs for specific components. The following are some of the uses of container tags in online marketing measures:

  • Empty tag - An empty HTML element, one with tag(s) but no content (HTML element § Empty element)

  • Nesting - In computing science and informatics, nesting[1] is where information is organized in layers, or where objects contain other similar objects. It almost always refers to self-similar or recursive structures in some sense.-->
